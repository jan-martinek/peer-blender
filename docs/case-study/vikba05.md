# Case-study: VIKBA05 Computer-aided Data Transformation

> This case study is about a course that is currently being taught. As such, it is continuously updated and may contain incomplete, unclear or misleading information. Feel free to contact me at [my e-mail address](mailto:honza.martinek@gmail.com) or discuss it in the github comments.

Peer Blender is currently being employed to teach a freshman course *VIKBA05 Computer-aided Data Transformation* at Masaryk University, Brno (Czech Republic).

There's 101 students in the course and the number of assessments in each unit is five (hence there should be 505 assessments every week). The course is worth 4 ECTS, that means that average student should spend 100—120 hours completing it. In a semester that is 12 weeks long, that translates into 8—10 hours every week.

To complete the course, the students need to 

- fulfill the weekly assignments (the average rating from every unit is added up into a final grade)
- write 5 assessments of others work every week (otherwise their score from their own assignment is lost)
- complete the final test with at least 65 % points (for a 90+ % success, there's a 3-point bonus)

## Structure of a learning unit

The course has a week-long teaching cycle, with a seminar every friday. All deadlines are set on 8pm. The [four phases](../about.md#phases) are set like this:

- **learning**: friday to monday (afternoon seminar)
- **assessment**: monday evening to thursday
- **objections**: thursday evening to friday (afternoon seminar)
- **final phase**: friday evening
    
In the 90 minutes-long seminar, there's

- **opening** (15 mins), summarizing the main points what's been the topic of the week
- **discussion** (60 mins) about problems with the content or the course itself
- **introduction** (15 mins) of next week's topic

The supposed *ideal* distribution of a student's work in a week is:

- **learning** (incl. assignment fulfilling): 3.5 hours
- **assessment**: 4 hours
- **objections**: 0.5 hours (preferrably)
- **final phase**: 1.5 hours
