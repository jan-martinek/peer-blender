# About Peer Blender

Peer Blender is a light-weight on-line homework peer-assessment tool. It's built upon the idea of "flipped classroom": *"In a flipped classroom, students watch online lectures, collaborate in online discussions, or carry out research at home and engage in concepts in the classroom with the guidance of the instructor."* [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flipped_classroom)

## Principles

There are several defining principles of Peer Blender:

- **flipped classroom** blended learning strategy
- **learning by teaching**: students learn not only in fulfilling their own assignments, but also when assessing the work of others — lessons should encourage students to give useful advice when the assessed assignment is poorly made
- every unit consists of **four phases**: <a id="phases"></a>
	- **learning**: students learn and fulfill the assignments
    - **assessment**: students assess the assignments submitted by others
    - **objections**: students can raise objections against the validity of the assessments (this is possible in the *assessment phase*, too; only in this phase, no new reviews emerge)
    - **final phase**: students can check who has written the reviews, discuss in detail the problems, browse through all the material that has been created in previous phases
- **transparency**: during the *assessment phase*, some information is hidden to keep the situation impersonal, but everything is made public in the *final phase* to promote the accountability of every participant
- **connectivism**: knowledge is found in the network
    - **meeting place**: students of various level of knowledge of the subject may meet in the peer-assessment, learning from each other
    - **browsing**: there's a built-in recommendation system (☆) to promote browsing through created content
    - **UTFG-textbook**: it is recommended to keep the instructions short and link to as much as possible to search queries in search engines (e. g. [example](http://google.com/search?q=example)) to make use of information available online and outside the course materials
- **advanced students as assistants**: it's common that some students need to get through a course on something they already know: in Peer Blender, it's possible for them to participate as assistants — focused more on helping others and deciding disputes
- **open to research**: the system logs various data points and provides interface for Google Analytics integration

# Use
